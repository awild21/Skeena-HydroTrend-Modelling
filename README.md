# Skeena-HydroTrend-Modelling
Supplementary HydroTrend inputs and outputs for Modelling the Skeena Watershed 1981-2100. Vaired climate inputs were averaged over thirty years and used as inputs for the HydroTrend model in order to assess subsequent hydraulic and sedimentologic outputs for each 30 year period leading up to 2100. See written work for further details.
