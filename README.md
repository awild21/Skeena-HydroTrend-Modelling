# Skeena-HydroTrend-Modelling
Supplementary HydroTrend inputs and outputs for Modelling the Skeena Watershed 1981-2100. Vaired climate inputs were averaged over thirty years and used as inputs for the HydroTrend model in order to assess subsequent hydraulic and sedimentologic outputs for the Skeena watershed during each 30 year period leading up to 2100. See written work for further details. 

Each model simulation required Hydro.HYPS and Hydro.IN input files. Hydro.IN files vary with each new climate scenario/time period and are saved in the same folder as their sebsequent outputs. Hydro.HYPS files are saved in the hypsometry folder and vary only depending on the subbasin of interest.
